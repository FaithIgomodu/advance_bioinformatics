Instructions:


9) Ask the user for a list of sequence lengths, separated by whitespace (Example: 100  123  45 
â€¦etc.). Store the sequence lengths as one string in a variable, then: 
a) Split that string and create an array from it (each number being an element of the array) 
b) Use a for loop to get the sum of all sequence lengths. 
c) Print the average.
